# ⚡ Skeleton

> Instantly scaffold full-stack projects with just one command—no boilerplate, no wasted time, just code that matters.

Skeleton is your dev setup sidekick. Whether you're launching a React + Flask project or exploring a new tech stack, Skeleton generates ready-to-run bash commands to scaffold your entire project structure in seconds. No more tedious boilerplate—just pick your stack and go.

---

## 🚀 Why Skeleton?

Developers waste too much time setting up full-stack environments from scratch. Skeleton fixes that by automating the boring stuff, so you can jump straight into building what really matters.

---

## 🛠 What It Does

- ⚡ Generates terminal-ready bash commands based on your selected tools
- 🔧 Supports full-stack scaffolds (e.g., React + Flask + MongoDB)
- 🖥 Intuitive UI for easy stack configuration
- 📦 Modular backend dynamically assembles project setups
- 🗃️ MongoDB-powered template storage for scalability and speed

---

## 🧪 How It Works

### 🖥 Frontend
- **React** – Handles stack selection and user interface
- **Styled with CSS frameworks** – Clean, responsive design

### 🧠 Backend
- **Python + Flask** – Serves APIs and processes command generation logic
- **MongoDB** – Stores and retrieves reusable project templates

---

## ⚙️ Example Workflow

1. Select your stack: React, Flask, MongoDB  
2. Click “Generate”  
3. Copy the generated bash command  
4. Paste it into your terminal  
5. Done. Your project is ready to go.
